Hello humans!

I am a knitter, spinner, and general creative getiing into coding and learning to upload files and pages to the web via coursera.com's Introduction to HMTL5 class.

I'm excited to learn to code, and I've had so much fun creating crazy themed practice pages.
One page I made was called atomic fishes, and it is a caotic place of random text, public domain images, and some radioactive fishies.
